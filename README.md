# RubyNote

A hobbyist project, designed not for production-use but for presentation of certain interesting tricks/techniques.
Main work happens in 'rubynote/rubynote'. Sandboxing is used to apply Ruby code to html imitating ERB. 
That technique is dangerous to be used in ruby as easy sandboxing can be bypassed, 
when using such a dynamic language as Ruby. I suggest using gem Keisan (github.com/project-eutopia/keisan).

RubyNote is meant to be a editor of documents/notes, ina  way of student's notebook: 
it is supposed to handle certain predefined structure.
It will be accomplished with extending this project to include document configuration, system and system of imports.
Also better preprocessing would be useful.
